#Hybrid spiral theme for SLiM
This theme is based on [slim-solarized-spiral-1920x1080](http://lekremyelsew.deviantart.com/art/SLiM-Arch-Linux-Solarized-Spiral-437966535) (I only ported the Arch 1920x1080 version so it's a WIP)
I just ported (tried to port) it to the [hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) colorscheme

#TODO:
* Find a better color for `msg_color` in slim.theme; the original solarized version was `#93a1a1`
* Add more resolutions (probably gonna need some help with this one because I'm a noob)
* Add versions for Manjaro and Debian (should be pretty easy)



The original (solarized) SVG source is [here](http://lekremyelsew.deviantart.com/art/Arch-Linux-Solarized-Spiral-SVG-Source-438082297) along with the other versions and their sources (they're in lekremyelsew's gallery)
